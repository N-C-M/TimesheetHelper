Timesheet Helper
===============

A C# app that runs in the background and collects the window names
of all windows where I have typed. It then stores the information 
in a SQLite database to then enable showing reports of activity.

The idea behind this? I suck at remembering what I did last week.
When timesheet filling time comes, I sometimes spend hours trying
to remember what I did. So instead of filling them daily, I made 
this app.

Some parts of the code may be useful for other purposes, so I 
thought I'd share it.
